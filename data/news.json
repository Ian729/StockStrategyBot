And I think the reason for that is that we've got a lot of policy balloons being floated out of Washington, D.C. And so the algorithms read the headlines and they start selling as soon as they see that the president's going to cap interest, interest rates on credit cards. That is not possible at 10%. I just don't see it happening. But you get the volatility in the short term. We saw it just recently with defense stocks. The president attacked them, and the stocks came back very nicely. Same with housing. So expect volatility.”</p><p>Data earlier on Wednesday showed producer prices in the U.S. matched forecasts in November, but retail sales topped expectations.</p><p>Other stocks on the move included Broadcom which fell four percent after China banned the use of its cybersecurity software due to national security concerns.</p><p>It was one of more than a dozen firms from the U.S. and Israel cited by the government in Beijing.</p>",
