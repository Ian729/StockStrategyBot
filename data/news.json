But we did get soft ADP (Automatic Data Processing employment report) numbers today, and that gives a little bit of direction and it supports the Fed's belief that the labor markets are softening. We know that inflation is ticking higher, but the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure), which is the indicator that the Fed pays attention to, wouldn't report until later in this month. So it's not necessarily impacted right this very second. I don't know that it (government shutdown) impacts much right now.\"</p><p>Healthcare stocks rallied for a second straight day, after Pfizer cut a deal with President Trump that grants the drug company tariff relief in exchange for lower prices on certain prescription drugs. </p><p>Pfizer gained more than six-and-a-half percent, Thermo Fisher added nearly nine-and-a-half percent.</p><p>:: AES</p><p>Other notable stock moves included AES, which rallied more than sixteen-and-a-half percent after the Financial Times reported that BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners was nearing a $38-billion deal to acquire the utility group.</p><p>:: File</p><p>:: Lithium Americas</p><p>And U.S.-listed shares of Canada's Lithium Americas soared more than 23% after the U.S. Department of Energy said it has taken a 5% stake in the mining company and a separate 5% stake in the company's Thacker Pass joint venture with General Motors.
