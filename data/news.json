But ultimately this is a problem with concentration at the top of the market, a few big stocks can bring the whole thing down. But the rotation under the surface has been pretty, I think, resilient. We've seen a lot of strength from other sectors. And, ultimately, I'm honestly pretty excited about this because I think that this sort of skepticism and hole poking in the AI trade is not something that happens in bubbles, in asset bubbles - there's a skepticism that I think is healthy and a rotation that is healthy as well.\"</p><p>Along with Broadcom, heavyweight AI leader Nvidia was a major drag on the S&amp;P 500, with shares losing more than 3%.</p><p>Other AI-related stock drops included SanDisk, which plunged more than 14.5%, CoreWeave, down 10% and nuclear technology firm Oklo, which lost more than 15%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury yields rose, also pressuring stocks, after a group of Federal Reserve officials who voted against the central bank's interest rate cut this week voiced worries that inflation remains too high to warrant lower borrowing costs.</p><p>The Labor Department's reports on nonfarm payrolls, consumer inflation and retail sales data are due next week and may offer greater insight into the health of the economy.</p>",
