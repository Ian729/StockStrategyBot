And there might be this wild card with the government shutdown since there's no data and the Fed is data dependent, they might have to pause the easing cycle until they get more data. The market is not ready for that. They want this easing cycle to continue. We are still where rates are restrictive on capital formation at this point in time. They need to continue to go down to support the positive momentum that's baked into the S&amp;P 500 now over 6,700 points.\"</p><p>Wall Street on Thursday was boosted largely by tech stocks, with Nvidia, Apple and Broadcom all closing higher.</p><p>On the flip side, consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest drag on the S&amp;P 500 due largely to a selloff in shares of Tesla, which ended down 5% for its biggest one-day percentage loss since late July.</p><p>And shares of credit bureaus Equifax and TransUnion fell 8.5% and 10.6%, respectively, after FICO launched a program that could allow mortgage lenders to gain access to credit scores without relying on the bureaus.</p><p>FICO shares surged almost 18% after the news.</p>",
