And I think that's largely because of Trump's comments around TikTok that we're close to a deal. I don't know why the market reacts to this stuff the way it does so quickly and then will reverse itself tomorrow - I think it's the hedge funds, the algorithms. But as an investor, I've continued to remain long - technology stocks, I think that is the place to be for some time, and so we're enjoying this run since the summer in tech names.\"Among those tech names, Apple rose more than 3%, as did Palantir Techologies, while Oracle climbed 4%.Other notable stock moves included FedEx, which popped over 2% after the delivery company reported quarterly profit and revenue above analyst estimates.And shares of Paramount Skydance jumped nearly 6% after a CNBC report laid out more details about the media company's potential bid for Warner Bros Discovery, which rose nearly 3.5%.",
