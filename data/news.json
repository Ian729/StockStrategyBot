So I think it's kind of one of those things where things have been up a lot and there's an opportunity to take some profits. And I think on some of these things, specifically in metals, I think there are some probably some margin calls because things are up still over 100% from a year ago. And I think people thought it would go on forever. I think there was concern about, you know, the level of Fed independence. And I think, you know, Warsh is a guy that's probably going to be a little bit more independent than some of the other candidates may have been.”</p><p>Stocks on the move Friday included Tesla, which rose more than 3% after reports that SpaceX is exploring deals with the EV maker and other companies run by Elon Musk.</p><p>Shares of Colgate-Palmolive gained about 6% after the toothpaste and soap maker forecast annual sales above Wall Street estimates on steady demand for household staples in markets such as Latin America and Europe.</p><p>And shares of Verizon Communications jumped nearly 12% after the company forecast annual profit and free cash flow above market expectations, with aggressive promotions during the peak holiday period fueling its highest quarterly wireless subscriber additions in six years.</p>",
