The insurer’s shares plunged nearly 20% after the Trump administration proposed a very small increase in Medicare insurer payment rates. The plan was another woe added to the company’s disappointing revenue forecast for 2026. The stocks of peers Humana and Aetna-owner CVS also plummeted.</p><p>Meanwhile, bellwether UPS rose fractionally after it projected higher revenue for 2026, also pulling up shares in rival FedEx which gained about two and a half percent.</p><p>Later this week, megacap technology companies report results.</p><p>Anna Rathbun, founder and CEO of Grenadilla Advisory says she thinks they will continue to boost the market though there could be some choppiness in the sector.</p><p>“I am positive on the S&amp;P 500. And I do think that it will be driven by technology, again, in some ways. I don't think it will be without volatility, because even among the large-scale tech players, AI players, there are things that are changing. So Nvidia for a long time was the winner in the AI race with its chip designing, AI chip designing capabilities. But then Google came out as a contender, and now Microsoft is making its own AI chips. So a lot of things are changing, even in the front of the winners of AI or perceived winners of AI. So that's going to be very interesting.”</p><p>On the economy front, U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly deteriorated in January, slumping to its lowest level since 2014. </p><p>Also on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting with the central bank expected to announce no change in interest rates on Wednesday.</p><p>Other stocks on the move included Corning, which surged 15.5% to a more than 25 year high after Meta said it would pay up to $6 billion for fiber-optic cables in AI data centers.</p><p>:: General Motors</p><p>And shares of General Motors jumped nearly 9% after the automaker posted a rise in core profit on higher demand for SUVs and pickup trucks.</p>",
