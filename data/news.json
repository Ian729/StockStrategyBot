The report put the annual inflation rate at 2.8%, still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.</p><p>While traders are betting the central bank will cut rates at its policy meeting next week, several Fed governors may dissent due to concerns about persistent inflation.</p><p>But Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance, points to other data that he believes should lead the Fed to lower rates.</p><p>\"The Leading Economic Index versus the Coincident, that's the future versus now, it's a ratio that some people look at, is actually one of the weakest we have seen, going back to the '80s - talking about three other times that we've seen a weak number. So that means we're strong today, not strong looking forward. And that can be pre-recessionary. So if I were on the Fed and you were asking me what I would do, I would probably cut rates this month as just a preventative measure.\"</p><p>Stocks on the move Friday included Warner Bros Discovery, which climbed more than 6% after Netflix agreed to buy its TV, film studios, and streaming division for $72 billion, ending a weeks-long bidding war.</p><p>Netflix shares closed nearly 3% lower, while shares of Paramount Skydance, one of the other bidders for Warner Bros, tumbled almost 10%.</p><p>And shares of Ulta Beauty surged more than 12.5% after the beauty retailer raised its annual sales and profit forecasts.</p>",
