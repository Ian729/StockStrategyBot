For the investors, I think a lot of people are pointing to the fact that these companies are very profitable and they have strong balance sheets, right? So they use that as an argument of why it's different than the tech bubble that we saw in the late 90s that ultimately burst in early 2000. But for an equity investor, the majority of the value of those shares still relies on expected earnings growth in the future.\"</p><p>:: File</p><p>Among the tech stocks that held steady on Friday... Nvidia, which gained more than one and a half percent, as investors prepare for the AI chipmaker's quarterly results on Wednesday, arguably the most critical of third-quarter earnings season.</p><p>Among other movers, Warner Bros Discovery gained 4% after the entertainment company said it had amended CEO David Zaslav's employment agreement amid a strategic review of its business.</p><p>And shares of Cidara Therapeutics more than doubled after Merck said it will acquire the company in an almost $9.2 billion deal.</p>",
