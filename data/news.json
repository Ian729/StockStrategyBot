But as I look at the beta (a measure of a stock's volatility, or risk, relative to the overall market) here recently, it's a 2.1, which means, again, you have the largest constituent by market cap moving at twice the amount of the market. So whatever happens, good or bad, it's going to have an outsized impact on what the trading looks like for the next couple of days.”</p><p>Shares of fellow chipmaker Broadcom and chip equipment maker Applied Materials each closed more than 4% higher.</p><p>Among the day's decliners, Target shares slipped nearly 3% after the retailer reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales.</p><p>Investors now turn their attention to Thursday's release of the September jobs report following the record-long U.S. government shutdown. </p>",
