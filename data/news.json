And so now what they're trying to do is become quicker, faster, reduce layers in corporate management. And indeed, that is what they are doing. And they're gonna grow the retail business with the same number of employees, but they're going to double it in five years. So that's pretty impressive. And as a shareholder, I kind of loved everything, and I think you continue to hold it.
