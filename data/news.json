And they end up just lending to the companies that have the best balance sheets, and usually that causes a retraction and the economy overall, and that's ultimately what keeps me up at night. So whenever we see these themes come up, whether or not it's can Oracle borrow money for their data centers, can AI raise money, private credit - are there issues there? They're all intertwined. It's how healthy is the economy and our lending system, and will the economy contract at a very rapid rate? And that's ultimately what my concern is.\"</p><p>Among other stock moves, Deere & Co jumped more than 11% after the farm-machinery maker raised its annual profit forecast and beat first-quarter results estimates.</p><p>Shares of advertising giant Omnicom jumped 15% after the company beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter revenue.</p><p>And shares of software provider EPAM Systems plunged 17% after its cautious first-quarter outlook disappointed investors.</p>",
