    "summary": "<p>STORY: Wall Street's main indexes ended higher on Friday, with the Dow adding nearly half a percent, the S&amp;P 500 gaining about seven-tenths of a percent and the Nasdaq climbing nine-tenths of a percent.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's global tariffs, in a rebuke of one of his key economic policies.</p><p>Trump called the ruling a \"disgrace\" and said he would impose a 10% global tariff for 150 days under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974.</p><p>Anna Rathbun is founder and CEO of Grenadilla Advisory.</p><p>“The markets are mostly in the green and have been throughout the day. And honestly, that is the market feeling a bit of a burden coming off of its shoulders. But it has been moving sideways during the day, not going straight up. And the reason for that, I think, is because it's still uncertain. Just because a ruling came in striking down Mr. Trump's tariffs, that doesn't mean that we're not going to have additional tariffs - and we just heard today that we will. And 150 days later, things might change again. So it makes the future uncertain.”</p><p>Some of Wall Street's most valuable and widely held companies rose, including a more than 3.5% rise in Google-parent Alphabet. Shares of Amazon and Apple also rallied.</p><p>Shares of several retailers hit by tariffs also gained, including toymaker Hasbro, online furniture retailer Wayfair, Pottery Barn-owner Williams-Sonoma and luxury furniture seller RH.</p><p>Among other movers, shares of Akamai Technologies slumped 14% after the cloud company forecast first-quarter adjusted profit below Wall Street estimates.</p><p>Meanwhile, data released early in the day showed U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, while a separate reading indicated inflation picked up in December.</p><p>Traders see just over a 50% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by its June policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.</p>",
