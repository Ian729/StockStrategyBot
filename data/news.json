So as we're starting to see some cracks in auto loans and certain areas in the economy that are representative of the more subprime or maybe creeping in a little bit of the prime lending rate categories, the high income earners, the top 10%, especially the top 1%, make up the vast majority of consumer spending, and that area continues to outperform. And that's what's driving the economy.\"Stocks on the move Friday included Electronic Arts, which jumped almost 15% after reports that the company was in advanced talks to go private.Shares of truck maker Paccar, which makes most of its vehicles for the U.S. market domestically, rose more than 5% a day after President Trump unveiled fresh import tariffs on heavy-duty trucks.Trump also slapped tariffs on branded pharmaceutical products.
