And I think it’s because even though we’re getting a lot of crosscurrents in the employment data, when you take a step back, the mosaic that emerges is that the labor market is indeed weakening. And I think the Fed is pretty laser focused on maintaining full employment without overheating the job market.”</p><p>Markets are now pricing in an 87% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.</p><p>Stocks on the move Thursday included Amazon, which dragged on the S&amp;P 500 with shares falling nearly one and a half percent.</p><p>Shares of Salesforce climbed more than three and a half percent after the company raised its revenue and profit forecasts, anticipating demand for its artificial intelligence agent platform.</p><p>And shares of Kroger fell more than four and a half percent after the supermarket chain narrowed its annual sales forecast and missed quarterly sales estimates.</p>",
