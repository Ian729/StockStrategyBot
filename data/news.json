It's happened eight times. All eight times, the market was higher one year out, median 14.5%. It's just pointing to the momentum that you get in the markets when you have a dovish Fed. And that is clearly what we have now.\"Financial stocks helped boost the Dow, with American Express gaining more than two-and-a-half percent and Goldman Sachs adding more than 1%.Among other movers, shares of Lyft popped more than 13% on the news that Alphabet's Waymo would launch autonomous cab rides in Nashville next year in collaboration with the ride-hailing firm. Shares of rival Uber fell 5%.:: WorkdayAnd shares of Workday jumped more than 7% on the news that activist investor Elliott Management took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider.",
