The latest attack on the Fed revived the “sell America” trade, with the dollar dropping on Monday and Treasuries selling off across the curve.  President Donald Trump’s aggressive calls for lower interest rates have threatened to undermine the Fed’s ability to control inflation and contributed to the so-called debasement trade where investors sell the dollar and other assets vulnerable to political and fiscal shocks.",

We look at the S&amp;P and as of today, it looks like it's slated for 14 to 15% earnings growth. And so that's good. Number 2 is while the AI, Magnificent Seven, part of those earnings, seems still positioned to grow high teens this year, we still see a broadening this year of the S&amp;P, shall you call it, 493. And that should be a positive as the earnings growth strengthens to low double digits for the remainder of the S&amp;P.
