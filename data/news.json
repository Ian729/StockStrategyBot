Tech right now represents 36% of the weighting of the S&amp;P 500 and really has been driving this market. From a valuation perspective, however, investors are getting a bit concerned because the S&amp;P is trading more than two standard deviations above the mean in terms of its 20-year relative P/E ratio, and it's at about a 40-plus percent premium to that P/E ratio. Tech stocks, however, have traded as much as a 73% premium to that 20-year average P/E ratio. So what's been happening is I think investors are saying, you know, we've done very, very well, but maybe we should take some profits while we can.\"</p><p>Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia lost 3% after Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group disclosed it sold all of its Nvidia shares for $5.8 billion.</p><p>Shares of Nvidia-backed CoreWeave slumped over 16% after the cloud computing firm trimmed its annual revenue forecast due to data center hiccups.</p><p>And shares of Nvidia rival AMD gained in extended trading after the company said it expects the market for its data center chips will grow to $1 trillion by 2030.</p>",
